# FRC Generic Autonomous Robot in CPP

This is a generic autonomous program that drives the robot with the specified
power for a set amount of time. It works with most of the 2018 legal motor
controllers and 2 or 4 motor drive configured robots. To use this program,
you must go through each of the "TODO" sections and select the appropriate
configurations and numbers.
